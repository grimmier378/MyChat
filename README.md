# MyChat​

## By Grimmier

## Basic Chat Window.​

This was inspired because I play on Project Lazarus, and we don't have tabbed chat windows. Combine that with EQ's horrible filtering. This lets you create your own event based filters.

## Features:​

* Customizable channels and colors.
* Channels get their own tab's you can toggle on or off.
* Main chat tab will show all channels always.
* Configure Channels from a GUI accessible from the options menu
* Right Clicking a tab will clear it.
* Reads settings from MyChat_Settings.ini MyChat_Settings.lua in the MQ\Config dir.
* You can customize any event string you would like and create a channel for it that you can turn on of off at any time.
* Toggling a channel on or off will save that setting to the settings lua as well.
* Edit and Add Channels and events through a GUI.
* ZOOM. right click a tab to turn on ZOOM mode. this will scale up the font size.
* ZOOM mode is not a true console, instead we are using a table with wrapped text rows.
* When Selecting a row or hovering with the mouse over one, pressing Ctrl-C will copy that line of text to the clipboard.
* for more refined copy toggle the zoom off and use the normal console.
* Auto locking Auto-Scroll, in Zoom mode.
* if you scroll up auto scrolling for that tab's zoom window will unlock.
* Scrolling back to the bottom will relock scroll on.
